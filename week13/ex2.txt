Deadlock prevention:
Deadlock prevention is straightforward check.
We should guarantee that the next allocation will not be a dedlock.
This method work with reduced throughput and it is not good.

Deadlock avoidance:
By deadlock avoidance we can avoid unsafe states, the system must be able to decide whether granting a resource is
safe or not and make the allocation only when it is safe, but it doesn't guarantee completion.
We should know information about future resource allocation which sometimes can be wrong.

Deadlock recovery:
Deadlock recovery is a approach of elimination already happened deadlock.
Can cause some strange behavior for process. Can be used together with previous deadlock strategies as the last check.
